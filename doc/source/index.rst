Welcome to pgimp's documentation!
=================================

Pgimp let's you interact with gimp in python3. Gimp itself only allows you
to use python2 and the documentation of its procedural database (pdb) is C-style
and not integrated into your IDE. Therefore pgimp generates python skeletons
for full autocompletion and documentation when writing scripts that will be
executed within gimp's python interpreter.
