Welcome to pgimp's documentation!
=================================

Pgimp let's you interact with gimp in python3. Gimp itself only allows you
to use python2 and the documentation of its procedural database (pdb) is C-style
and not integrated into your IDE.

Therefore pgimp generates python skeletons
for full autocompletion and documentation when writing scripts that will be
executed within gimp's python interpreter.

Furthermore pgimp provides python3 classes and methods to interact with gimp files
or whole collections of files conveniently.
